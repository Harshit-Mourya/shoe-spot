# Shoe Spot â€“ Full-Stack E-Commerce Platform
Built a full-stack e-commerce web application using the MERN stack. Users can browse, filter, and purchase shoes with features like dynamic search, cart management, and secure JWT-based authentication. Originally a front-end React project, it was upgraded to include Node.js and MongoDB for full functionality. Key features include product filtering, search, user login/register, order tracking, and a responsive design for all devices. This project strengthened my skills in building RESTful APIs, database management, and full-stack application design.
